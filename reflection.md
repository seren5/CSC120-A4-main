- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
My initial impressions were that it's very important to figure out what needs access to each thing, so that they can be determined to be public or private.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The brackets were still confusing, and making it object oriented was very confusing, so I'd lay out each section more clearly for myself if I could do it again. For someone taking this course in the future, it'd probably be to plan everything accordingly.
